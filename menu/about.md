Computer scientist interested in various flavors of machine learning, psychology and financial markets. 

I hold a M.Sc degree in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence from Technical University of Munich, Germany. 

I have experience in areas of predictive maintance, autonomous driving and robotics. 

I am currently working as a research engineer at ARRIVAL. I am using deep reinforcement learning to to teach real robots how to assemble stuff. 

This website is designed to be my personal testing grounds for various projects, assignments, observations and reflexions.   
After hours, I am a lifelong learner, fitness enthusiast and self-proclaimed food aficionado.
