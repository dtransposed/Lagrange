Hello, my name is Damian and I am computer scientist interested in various flavors of machine learning, neurobiology and financial markets. I hold a M.Sc degree in Robotics, Cognition and Intelligence from Technical University of Munich, Germany. I have experience in areas of predictive maintance, autonomous driving and robotics. I am currently working as a research engineer focused on reinforcement learning applications  in industrial robots.
This website is designed to be my personal testing grounds for various projects, assignments, observations and reflexions.   
After hours, I am a lifelong learner, fitness enthusiast and self-proclaimed food aficionado.
